  Set the IP Address env var and print it to stdout, using a custom endpoint
  to retrieve the IP.

  This command needs to ping an external endpoint to retrieve its IP. When the
  `endpoint` parameter is provided, this endpoint is fed directly into `wget`
  and is expected to return the IP address in plain text as the response body.
